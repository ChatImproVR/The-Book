Everyone! (TODO: Inclusive design)

## How does ChatImproVR work?
**ChatImproVR is based** on plugins. Plugins run on both the **Client** and the **Server**. Each plugin adds functionality to the virtual world by providing a number of **Systems**. We refer to the **Client** or the **Server** as the **"Host"**. **Systems** communicate with the **Host** via **Channels** and via the Entity Component System (**ECS**).

## Channels
Messages are sent on 
Each **Channel** is referred to by it's **Unique ID**. This ID  

## ECS
