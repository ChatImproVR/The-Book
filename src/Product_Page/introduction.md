# ChatImproVR

## What is ChatImproVR?
ChatImproVR is a virtual world platform, with goals similar to that of VRChat, Neos, or SecondLife. A virtual world platform is a game engine and a set of tools to create and experience an immersive virtual space. These virtual spaces are then hosted online, where users can join them to socialize and enjoy the activities in the virtual world.

ChatImproVR will improve on existing virtual world platforms by promoting open source software and prioritizing user control over content, all while featuring excellent flexibility.
