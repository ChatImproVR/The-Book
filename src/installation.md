# Installation
This section primarly focus on installing our ChatImproVR engine.

## Minimum Requirement
As of now, the engine operates on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but it only operates Windows System for VR.  

At the same time, the engine has been tested on two seperate VR headsets: Oculus VR and SteamVR. 

Therefore, if you have a different system, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/ChatImproVR/chatimprovr/issues/82) to see any updates with it. We will update this page as soon as possible if there is a new method for additional support. 

While we said that it only works on Windows operating system for the two VR headsets, there is still hardware equipment.

We cannot provide the most accurate requirement; however, the PC must able to run the VR supported Softwares. For example, the Oculus VR headset must need to connect the PC. (Trust me, I(Ken) has tested on a weak laptop, and it says that it cannot run that application to connect the VR headset). Please make sure that the VR headset supported software is able to run and connect the headset.
