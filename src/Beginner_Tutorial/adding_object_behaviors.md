# Adding Object Behaviors
Up to now, we have worked around the fundamentals of the plugin and creation of objects/entities. This section is the highlight of the plugin where things get interesting overall.

There are several things we need to add behavior for each object. Here is a list what will it be.
- User Input Movement Control for Player (user input)
- Random Input Movement Control for Enemy (random input)
- User Input Fire Control for Player (user input)
- Random Input Fire Control for Enemy (random input)
- Bullet Interaction between each entity (spawning, collision)

But before start working on these behaviors, we need to do some updates for the entities we created previously.

## Adding more component/characteristics to the entity

### Player (from Client to Server)

### Enemy (within Server)

## Fire Control
